## **Objective:** 
This project explores factors influencing maternal health risks using various machine learning models, such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest, and Decision Trees. The goal is to identify the most effective algorithm for accurate risk prediction. Insights from this analysis aim to improve maternal health monitoring, helping healthcare providers deliver personalized interventions.
